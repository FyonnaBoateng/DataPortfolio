## Are Birds Real?

Ah yes, yet again we are subject to seemingly unthinkable trends on the internet. I noticed a few months ago that the conspiracy *Birds Aren't Real* was blowing up on Twitter and Reddit, and I wondered if there was anything interesting about who was tweeting it, what they were tweeting about, and why. Welp, I'll give it a shot with the little information I've taught myself.

Wikipedia gives a great explanation of the origins of this theory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_Aren\%27t_Real

## Data - Where is it from?

I grabbed some data from the lovely Kaggle.com from both Reddit and Twitter. Whether I will use both of these datasets... time will tell.

I haven't a clue what exactly to do now, but I think I'll start with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get an idea of what potential patterns could be present in this data. There might not be any. That's okay too.

I have some theories about what I could potentially see in the data:

1) I have a feeling that Social Identity Theory will have some influence here. An example being that individuals will receive more downvotes if their post or comment is incongruous with the rest of the subreddit. 

2) "[This](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1368430220987596)" study influences my second theory. I feel that similar findings will be present here, and that there will be a strong presence of aggressive words, dividing language, etc. I'll use the main words and themes found here to see if their findings are applicable and able to be replicated in this context. 

[comment]: <> (try to find the reason why people are coming together with this, potentially investigate whether there are people who are trying to disagree? social identity theory?)
