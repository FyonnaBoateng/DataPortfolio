## Are Birds Real?

Ah yes, yet again we are subject to seemingly unthinkable trends on the internet. I noticed a few months ago that the conspiracy *Birds Aren't Real* was blowing up on Twitter and Reddit, and I wondered if there was anything interesting about who was tweeting it, what they were tweeting about, and why. Welp, I'll give it a shot with the little information I've taught myself. 

Wikipedia gives a great explanation of the origins of this theory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_Aren%27t_Real

## Data - Where is it from?

I grabbed some data from the lovely Kaggle.com from both Reddit and Twitter. Whether I will use both of these datasets... time will tell.

I haven't a clue what exactly to do now, but I think I'll start with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get an idea of what potential patterns could be present in this data. There might not be any. That's okay too.
