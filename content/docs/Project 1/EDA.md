## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Work in Progress)

To start, I'm going to do an exploratory data analysis on both data sets. I'm using the *Machine Learning With Python* by Oliver Theobald as a starting point.
Let's start by importing Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

```python
{
  import pandas as pd
  import seaborn as sns
  %matplotlib inline
}
```
