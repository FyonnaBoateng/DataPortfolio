**Welcome! - About Me**

Hi there! My name is Fyonna Boateng and I am a Psychology undergraduate at the University of Reading.

I have a developing interest in the relationship between social sciences and data science/analytics. This portfolio will document my progress as I teach myself Python, SQL, and LaTeX .I will more specifically focus on learning how to use Python to analyse data, and potentially learn basic machine learning (ML). 

It is with this knowledge that I hope I am able to be a researcher in the interdisciplinary field of computational social science (CSS).

Thanks so much for visiting and I hope that my site is enjoyable to visit.

Fy
