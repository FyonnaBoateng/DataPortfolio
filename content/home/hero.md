Welcome to my online portfolio! My name is Fyonna and I study Psychology at the University of Reading. I have a developing interest in the relationship between social sciences and data science/analytics. This portfolio will document my progress as I teach myself Python, SQL, and LaTeX.

Thanks so much for visiting and I hope that my site is enjoyable to visit.
