**Welcome! - About Me**

Hi there! My name is Fyonna Boateng and I am a Psychology undergraduate at the University of Reading.

I have a developing interest in the relationship between social sciences and data science/analytics. This portfolio will document my progress as I teach myself Python, SQL, and LaTeX .I will more specifically focus on learning how to use Python to analyse data, and potentially learn basic machine learning (ML). 

Thanks so much for visiting and I hope that my site is enjoyable to visit. This entire site is designed using my GitHub, which is always a challenge. 

Feedback is always appreciated.
