<h3>Welcome! - About Me</h3>
<p>Hi there! My name is Fyonna Boateng and I am a Psychology undergraduate at the University of Reading.</p>
<p>I have a developing interest in the relationship between social sciences and data science/analytics. This portfolio will document my progress as I teach myself <strong>Python, SQL, and LaTeX&nbsp;</strong>.I will more specifically focus on learning how to use Python to analyse data, and potentially learn basic <strong>machine learning (ML).&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>It is with this knowledge that I hope I am able to be a researcher in the interdisciplinary field of <em><strong>computational social science (CSS).</strong></em></p>
<p>Thanks so much for visiting and I hope that my site is enjoyable to visit.</p>
<p><strong>Fy</strong></p>
